1. Event listening:
io.on("connection", ...) listens for new connections to the server.
socket.on("message", ...) listens for events from a specific client.


2. Emitting events:
io.emit(...) sends an event to all connected clients.
socket.emit(...) (not shown in this code) would send an event to only this specific client.
socket.broadcast.emit(...) sends an event to all clients except the sender.

io operations affect all connections.
socket operations are specific to one client connection.



socket.join(roomName) is a Socket.IO method that allows a socket (representing a client connection) to join a specific "room". In Socket.IO, a room is a concept that allows you to group sockets together, making it easy to broadcast messages to a subset of clients.
Here's a more detailed explanation:
1. Concept of Rooms:
In Socket.IO, a room is like a channel or a virtual grouping of socket connections.
Rooms don't need to be created explicitly; they are created automatically when the first socket joins them.
A socket can be in multiple rooms at the same time.
2. Joining a Room:
When socket.join(roomName) is called, it adds the socket to the specified room.
If the room doesn't exist, it's created automatically.
This operation is typically performed on the server side.
3. Effect of Joining:
Once a socket has joined a room, it will receive any messages broadcast to that room.
This allows for targeted messaging to a group of sockets without affecting other connections.
4. Use Cases:
Rooms are often used to implement features like:
Chat rooms where multiple users can communicate
Game lobbies where players in the same game instance can receive updates
Topic-based notifications where users subscribe to specific topics

5. In Your Code:
   socket.on("join-room", (roomName) => {
     socket.join(roomName);
     // ... other operations ...
   });
When a client emits a 'join-room' event, the server responds by calling socket.join(roomName).
This adds the client's socket to the specified room, allowing it to receive messages sent to that room.

6. Sending Messages to Rooms:
After joining, you can send messages to all sockets in a room using:
     io.to(roomName).emit('someEvent', data);
- This sends the 'someEvent' with data to all sockets in roomName.

7. Leaving Rooms:
Sockets can leave rooms using socket.leave(roomName).
This is useful when a user wants to exit a chat room or when you need to manage room memberships dynamically.
In summary, socket.join(roomName) is a crucial method for implementing room-based functionality in Socket.IO. It allows you to organize connected clients into groups, facilitating targeted communication and enabling features like separate chat rooms or game instances within a single application.
